# Dataquest_projects
Notebooks from selected Dataquest guided projects, with some additional workings. Listed in order of advancement through the dataquest datascience path.

## NYC schools - 
Uses Requests library to get json data from some APIs, about New York city schools and their SAT results/demographics. Processes the datasets using pandas and combines them into a single dataset for further analysis. Some initial visual data discovery of correlations. Requires basemap library for one step. 

## Analysis of Jeopardy questions - 
Uses pandas, some string maniulation and data cleaning, and a chisquared test to look for study tips for winning Jeopardy. In particular we look at word recurrances in strings, and whether given words correlate with high value questions.

## Car Price Prediction - 
Uses the k-nearest neighbours machine learning algorithm to predict car prices from numeric features (like horsepower or fuel efficiency). Includes some preliminary data cleaning. Still a work in progress as I plan to add cross validation to replace the train/test method for generating error statistics.
